Besiege Vertibird V4
==================
A counter rotating prop driven tilt-wing heavily inspired by the Vertibird featured in Fallout 2.

Besiege creation with accompanying script for advanced out of the box operation acting as an initial proof of concept. 

Controls
========

z - start engines - a nice little gimmick simulating a real helicopter start up. 

Numpad Plus - increase altitude
Numpad minus - decrease altitude

left arrow/right arrow - rotate left and right
up arrow/ down arrow - move forward and back via nascelle rotation

f - fire nose cannons
v - drop bombs

Installation
============

You will firstly need to have  [Lachim's Scripting Mod](http://forum.spiderlinggames.co.uk/forum/main-forum/besiege-early-access/modding/24172-spaar-s-modloader-lachcim-s-scripting-mod-beta-for-besiege-0-10) and [Spaars Mod Loader v0.3.3](http://forum.spiderlinggames.co.uk/forum/main-forum/besiege-early-access/modding/8432-spaar-s-mod-loader-0-3-3-%7C-1-0-0-beta9-besiege-v0-11) installed first.

Then copy Vertibirdv4.bsa into SavedMachines and Vertibirdv4.lua into the Scrips folders found in the Besiege installation directory.
For steam users this will be C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Besiege.

Future Development
==================

- Implementation of a finite state machine for overall future complexity reduction
- Focus on control responsiveness as well as a new method to govern thrust output dynamically based on the situation
- Implement states and movements for the conservation of momentum for a more realistic flight control. 
- Inprovements to the flight model to include independent nescelle rotations and thrust for more responsive control.
